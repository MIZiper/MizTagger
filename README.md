# MizTagger

MizTagger is a tool to manage files with Tags.
Programmers must be familiar with flags and binary logic (and, or, not). Then use the binary to filter what we want.

The tool is targeted to .NET Framework 4, but it's source code here, so use visual studio to compile it, should be OK.

The tool use SQLite, emm ... just expressing my thanks.

Download the compiled version from "Releases" page.
There's a "ReadMe.docx" to explain how to use, and the concept of Tags. (But it's such a tiny tool that you can easily know how)

It's now a demo-like version, no idea about the performance, if you have good ideas or advices, please let me know, thank you!
I'm not sure about the future of this tool. :(
